# Downstream — who consumes this library

**This library is not standalone infrastructure. It is part of a product.**

## Consumer: Scimeto / CitationGuard

- **Repo:** `~/Vibe/MetaScienceTools/CitationGuard` — <https://github.com/giladfeldman/Scimeto>
- **Pinned in:** `apps/worker/package.json`, by **git tag** (`github:giladfeldman/torturedcheck#vX.Y.Z`)
- **Uses:** tortured-phrase detection
- **Reaches users through:** the tortured-phrase processor, whose output is shown to researchers
  as findings about their manuscript and exported into reports they act on.

Scimeto's side of this relationship is documented in
`CitationGuard/docs/SUBCOMPONENTS.md`, and the two are checked against each other
mechanically by `CitationGuard/scripts/review/subcomponent-sync-check.mjs` (grep-checks
R24), which fails if this file goes missing or stops naming Scimeto.

## What that means for a change here

Scimeto is a **scientific-integrity platform**. Its failure mode is not a crash — it is
a plausible, confident, wrong answer that no test catches: a green badge on a manuscript
with real findings, a count that is silently zero, an all-clear over a check that never
ran. A defect in this library becomes exactly that, and it reaches a researcher.

So:

1. **A test watched failing against the defect first.** Break the fix and see it go red
   before trusting it. A test written after the fix that re-asserts current behaviour
   proves nothing.
2. **A failure mode the return type cannot express is a bug in the type.** If a caller
   cannot distinguish "checked, clean" from "could not check", it will report the
   former — and it will be wrong in the direction that matters.
3. **Offline tests for failure modes.** Suites that hit live APIs cannot express
   "and now the upstream rate-limits you". Mock the transport.

## Releasing

The pin downstream resolves a **TAG**. A commit on `main` with no tag changes nothing
for Scimeto, and Railway installs from the tag, so a local path or branch override will
pass locally and fail on deploy.

1. test → `npm run build` → `npm test`
2. bump `package.json`, add a **CHANGELOG** entry naming the defect, the evidence, and
   what a consumer must now do differently
3. commit, `git tag vX.Y.Z`, **push the tag**
4. in Scimeto: bump the pin in *every* manifest that declares it, `npm install` (so the
   lockfile records it), update the consumer to actually use what the release added,
   then `npm run verify`
5. deploy Scimeto — a released fix nobody deployed is a fix nobody has

Step 4's "actually use it" is not optional bookkeeping: a capability no call site
invokes is not shipped, and the library's own tests pass either way.
